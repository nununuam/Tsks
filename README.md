# Tsks
Tsks is a tasks/to-do tracker that allows user to input different tasks with the date and time it is at. It will organize the tasks/todo by the order it needs to be done by. I am a student so for students, it allows them to input all their assignments/readings by the date it needs to be done at and it will show the order in which things are due. This app provide the ability to add different tasks across all fields (classes, personal life ..etc) and it organize it by the day it needs to be done. It intertwine all aspects of one's life.
